              When I was a teenager, personal computers had evolved and become
              affordable. I realized I could invent by using fewer resources.
              Sometimes, a computer was all I needed to create something new,
              like a new program. I became interested in computers and chose it
              as a top priority field of study.

          My first journey that I chose to share is what I am most passionate
          about.
        </Header>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.33em" }}>
          It is unavoidable that money is important and a part of everyoneâ€™s
          life. Moreover, many people think and believe that being a rich person
          is the highest goal for their life to make their lives easier.
          Conversely, the truth is that the passion for money and richness
          causes them to become dependent and upon other things such as people
          and events. For instance, some people behave unethically killing or
          stealing for money. It is clear that wealth can control people.
          <b> However, for me, I prefer to be a memorable person.</b> It is true
          that a memorable person can be either bad or good. The way I chose to
          be is the middle between them because I realize that nobody is perfect
          and we all can make mistakes. Thomas Edison did not produce light
          bulbs in a single time. His success causes us to remember his name
          even he had met many failures before he found the way to build light
          bulbs. Somehow, the mistakes and failures inspire people to try again
          and avoid making the same mistakes. Before I found my passion for
          being a memorable person, I always said to myself that I still had
          tomorrow and other days to improve my standing among my friends and my
          family. However, now my thoughts have changed. Now I understand the
          very things I need to improve my circumstances, such as acceptance of
          others requires courage. Then I try to do like today is the last day
          of my life in everything from being a good student, a rewarding son
          and a likable friend. Therefore, I have to be brave to step out of my
          comfort zone to achieve my goal of being memorable. That is my
          passion.
