      "Our team decided to create an application where you could have discussions, debates and polls about various topics with different users of the application. Users would be able to create their own profiles, their own debates, and their own polls that other users could interact with in real time. This is innovative because it makes the debate more interesting since it is in real time between two people. They can interact quickly for an unlimited amount of time until one of them ends a the debate. It is also innovative because it allows other users to give their opinion on who won the debate with a vote that is counted in real time. In order for the debate and discussion section to work the redits server must be used.",
