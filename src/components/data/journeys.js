      "The subject I want to study is astronomy.  The universe is too big to imagine and we are too small to be comparable.  While the universe has evolved for 13.7 billion years, the timeline of modern human evolution is only around 0.07 million years.  In my opinion, we are not close to understanding the universe. Now we still do not even understand the human mind.  The universe hides many secrets like a human mind which is hard to discover and understand.  It is challenging for me, but it is also able to keep my interest.  Every time when I look at the sky, I see many shiny stars. They are very beautiful; however, they are just a rock.  I am never disappointed looking at the stars, the moon, and the sky and reading about the universe.  I would be scared of its darkness and silence should the sky be without any stars at night.  Therefore, having them in the sky is the same reason as everyone is born for a reason.  Moreover, I believe that if I want to understand the biggest thing like the universe, I must begin to understand the small things first, including myself. Psychology is a key and way which I can learn and understand about myself and human minds. ",

      "I am a positive thinking person. Also, I consider myself an optimist versus pessimist.  I look at a glass as being half full rather than being half empty.  Optimism creates opportunities while pessimism destroys them. When I expect good things to happen, it will lead me to take actions that produce positive results.  On the other hand, expecting bad things will lead me to minimize taking actions.  Then negative results will be produced.  I always say to myself that every cloud has a silver lining every time I meet bad situations.  Therefore, many times I am met with terrible situations, but I try to find the humor in even the most unfunny situations and make the best of them.  The sadness and stress can destroy my health while the humor and my laugh are literally medicinal.  They help me to be healthier.  Whenever I am in such a situation, I do not want people around me to be upset and sad by me.  I realize my emotion and feeling are contagious to others and from the others is too.  Learning in psychology enhances understanding of others.  It improves my ability to prevent othersâ€™ emotional hardship and not to think harm to myself and others.  It makes my thought and intention is not easily influenced and made worse by others. Therefore, I strongly choose to be positive thinking and choose my company who fill my cup of optimism.",

      "In 2009, my older sister and I flew from Thailand to the United States to take our summer vocation. When we arrived in Houston, my sister strongly wanted to try to enroll in a general school as American. Therefore, we decided to apply to a school. Fortunately, although we traveled alone, we had our cousin there who was working there. Consequently, we could apply a general school in US easily because we were supported by educate laws, and then I studied in Yes Prep Middle School.  Studying there caused me to conceal the truth that I had to leave after two months; moreover, I had not elicited this even before I left everyone who I met there. Everything that occurred there seems like it was yesterday.My sister and I had to apply a different school because she was in grade 10th, while I was in grade 7th.It caused us had to help ourselves and tried to speak English more than I had used before.I almost never met my sister during school although my school and her school are connected together.While I was studying in the school, I had a lot of chances to meet and make friends.Even though I encountered many problems, my friends always helped me to resolve them, but I still had one problem that nobody could help me to resolve it.The big my problem was conversation in English.I could not convey all of my requirements or my personality.I felt cramped and was in a narrow space because I was in this situation for a long time.As the result, I counted the days and waited for the last day.On my last day in the school, I did everything normally, and nobody included my friends knew that I would disappear on the next day.I repeated my memory that I did not say goodbye to my friend.I think I was selfish and it was the wrong decision. After returning to my country, I continued to study in my real school.It was my school before going there.I regret that I did not say any word, even an easy word like goodbye to my friend there.The story occurred six years ago.The fade memory and my friendship there seem they were destroyed since I left there, but I still hoped I would find a way to meet them again.Someday I searched on the Internet as normal days.I recalled the memory and my friends, and then I tried to find them on Facebook.I found friends who are across the world, and whom I had never had contacted in six years, and we talked to each other again and truly in the deep of my mind was guilty.One of them told me that they just had talked about me a week ago.I really appreciated that they could remember my story when I was there, and technology helped me and my friends to be more than just acquaintances. The story that I mentioned affected my future.After coming back to normal, my grades were better than before I got the experience.While sometime I though the studying that place taught me to have more responsibility; in additional, the next term, I was a leader in my class.In 2014, I graduated from my high school.I planed to continue my education in US and face many challenges, and especially my old friends.Eventually, now I am in US and I am still waiting someday that I will meet them.This time will not be same the past because the words that I will speak with them is hello.",
