      "The subject I want to study is astronomy.  The universe is too big to imagine and we are too small to be comparable.  While the universe has evolved for 13.7 billion years, the timeline of modern human evolution is only around 0.07 million years.  In my opinion, we are not close to understanding the universe. Now we still do not even understand the human mind.  The universe hides many secrets like a human mind which is hard to discover and understand.  It is challenging for me, but it is also able to keep my interest.  Every time when I look at the sky, I see many shiny stars. They are very beautiful; however, they are just a rock.  I am never disappointed looking at the stars, the moon, and the sky and reading about the universe.  I would be scared of its darkness and silence should the sky be without any stars at night.  Therefore, having them in the sky is the same reason as everyone is born for a reason.  Moreover, I believe that if I want to understand the biggest thing like the universe, I must begin to understand the small things first, including myself. Psychology is a key and way which I can learn and understand about myself and human minds. ",

      "I am a positive thinking person. Also, I consider myself an optimist versus pessimist.  I look at a glass as being half full rather than being half empty.  Optimism creates opportunities while pessimism destroys them. When I expect good things to happen, it will lead me to take actions that produce positive results.  On the other hand, expecting bad things will lead me to minimize taking actions.  Then negative results will be produced.  I always say to myself that every cloud has a silver lining every time I meet bad situations.  Therefore, many times I am met with terrible situations, but I try to find the humor in even the most unfunny situations and make the best of them.  The sadness and stress can destroy my health while the humor and my laugh are literally medicinal.  They help me to be healthier.  Whenever I am in such a situation, I do not want people around me to be upset and sad by me.  I realize my emotion and feeling are contagious to others and from the others is too.  Learning in psychology enhances understanding of others.  It improves my ability to prevent othersâ€™ emotional hardship and not to think harm to myself and others.  It makes my thought and intention is not easily influenced and made worse by others. Therefore, I strongly choose to be positive thinking and choose my company who fill my cup of optimism.",
